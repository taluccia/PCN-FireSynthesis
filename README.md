Thawing degree days are a measure of the combined duration and magnitude of above 0C temperatures during the thawing season (or any particular date range). So, a sum of the above 0 temperatures between particular dates. For example, let's say between June 1 and 13 the average was 20C everyday. The thawing degree days would be 260. Thawing degree days (TDD) can be used to approximate the active layer depth at any given date when you don't have a measurement, because active layer depth is the square root of TDD.
